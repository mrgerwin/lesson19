Creating the Animal Class - Task A

### Complete Task A
I have already completed Task B for you as animials.py which is just a testing program for your cows and sheep.  It is your job to program the animal_class, cow_class and sheep_class.  A blank template is provided for each.  Upload your completed classes to github.  Don't forget to test your classes. All files must be in the same folder on your computer for this to work.

### Discussion Questions
1. What are some difficulties you are still having with Object Oriented Programming.  Be as specific as possible.
2. If you are having no problems, describe how you might use objects for your main project for 2nd quarter.
