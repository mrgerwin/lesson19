Creating the Animal Class - Task A

### Complete Task A
I have already completed Task B for you as animials.py which is just a testing program for your cows and sheep.  It is your job to program the animal_class, cow_class and sheep_class.  A blank template is provided for each.  Upload your completed classes to github.  Don't forget to test your classes.
